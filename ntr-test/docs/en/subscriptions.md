# Training registrations - Sign up for trainings

## Overview

Easily sign up for trainings that interest you. It's the first step - signing up is free and allows you to participate when the time comes.

## How it works

### What is a registration?
A registration is your intention to participate in a training session. It's like 'reserving a place' - you show interest but do not commit to actually attending.

### Benefits of signing up
- **Free**: There is no cost to sign up for a voucher
- **Flexibility**: You can unsubscribe at any time
- **Overview**: You see all the trainings you are interested in
- **Reminders**: You remember which trainings are available

## Sign up for trainings

### Here's how you do it
1. Go to the **Registration page**
2. Browse the available trainings
3. Read the description of each training
4. Click **"Register"** next to the training you want to attend
5. Confirm your registration

### What you see for each training
- **Title and description**: What the training is about
- **Date and time**: When the training takes place
- **Location**: Where the training is held
- **Available seats**: How many people can attend
- **Registration status**: Whether you are already registered or not

## Manage your registrations

### See your registrations
- **Registration page**: Shows all trainings you are registered for

### Unregister from trainings
1. Go to the **Registration page**
2. Find the training you want to unregister from
3. Click **"Unregister"**

## Important rules

### Registration vs attendance
- **Registration is free**: You can register for as many trainings as you want

- **No obligation**: Registration does not mean you have to attend

### Timeframes
- **Register in advance**: Register as soon as you know you are interested
- **Cancel in time**: Cancel your registration if you know you cannot attend
- **No time limit**: You can withdraw at any time

## Tips for smart registration management

### Plan your training sessions
1. **Sign up for interesting trainings**: Sign up for trainings that seem interesting
2. **Keep an eye on your schedule**: Make sure your trainings don't clash with other activities
3. **Be realistic**: Don't sign up for more trainings than you can handle

### Manage changes
1. **Cancel in time**: If you know you cannot attend, cancel as soon as possible
2. **Communicate**: Inform the trainer if you cannot attend
